# your-dns
A docker-compose file to provide a secure adblocking DNS server

**NOTE**: if you are interested in a hosted solution, please take a look at
[nextdns.io](https://nextdns.io). I'm not affiliated with nextdns.io.

## Goal

Run a secure DNS server (DNS-over-TLS for now, will add DNS-over-HTTPS
later) that can do ad blocking and hide your DNS query from your ISP.

## Non Goal

Hide your DNS query from upstream recursive DNS server. Why? Because to
me hide my trail from various ISPs (Verizon, ATT, and any other ISPs
behind public WiFis) is more important.

## All components in this stack

1. [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/): A DNS server
   that provide DNS-over-TLS service.
   ([doc](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/))
1. [Pihole](https://pi-hole.net): Ad blocking DNS server. Pihole forked
   dnsmasq and provide a nice UI to manage the DNS server.
   ([donate](https://pi-hole.net/donate/))
1. [Stubby](https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Daemon+-+Stubby):
   A DNS stub server, which support forwarding DNS request to upstream
   DNS-over-TLS server. Note Unbound also support forwarding request to
   upstream over TLS, but I was told (can't find the reference) Unbound
   does not reuse TLS connections which is a concern to me (my ATT
   gateway has an internal NAT table with limited # of entries).
   ([doc](https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/Configuring+Stubby))
1. [Pomerium](https://pomerium.io): A identity-aware reverse proxy. This
   allows me to remote access PiHole's web UI.
   ([reference](https://www.pomerium.io/reference/))
1. [Autoheal](https://github.com/willfarrell/docker-autoheal):
   Auto-restart container that failed health check.
1. [Ouroboros](https://github.com/pyouroboros/ouroboros): Auto-pull
   latest version of each container.

## Run the stack

The following instruction will run a list of jobs on docker to
DNS-over-TLS service on port 853 and foward your request through PiHole
then to Google DNS.

**NOTE**: if you don't trust Google, please modify `./stubby/stubby.yml` and
specify a different `upstream_recursive_servers`. A list of available
DNS-over-TLS name server is available at
https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Test+Servers.

1. Create a network called `infra_network`. (Why not create the network
   in the compose file? Because you cannot *create* the `default` network
   in compose file, and can only *replace* it with `external`.)
```
    docker network create --subnet 172.30.0.0/16 infra_network
```

2. Create an `.env` file in the directory of `docker-compose.yaml` file
   with the following content:

```
DNS_DOMAIN_NAME=dns.example.com
# All the remaining are optional.
# If you don't want remote access to pihole web UI, remove pomerium from
# docker-compose.yaml file.
# See https://www.pomerium.io/docs/identity-providers.html on detailed
# instruction.
POMERIUM_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
POMERIUM_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
# Generate two random strings using `head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64`
POMERIUM_SHARED_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_STRING
POMERIUM_COOKIE_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_STRING
```

3. Use your favorate ACME client to create free certificate from Let's
   Encrypt and save it in `./letsencrypt` directory. If your domain
   name's NS is Cloudflare, the following is an example on how to do it
   within docker:
```
  certbot:
    image: certbot/dns-cloudflare:latest
    container_name: certbot
    dns: 172.29.1.1
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./letsencrypt/etc:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./letsencrypt/var:/var/lib/letsencrypt
      - ./letsencrypt/credentials.txt:/credentials.txt
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"	
```
4. `docker-compose up -d` and you are done :-)

## TODO

1. DNS-over-HTTPS support (Personally not using any device that supports
   it).
